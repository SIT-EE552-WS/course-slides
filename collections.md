# Lecture 5

## Collections

---

## Outline

- Refresh on limitations of Arrays
- How _collections_ improve over arrays
- The Collection API
- The "Enhanced" For Loop

---

### Limitations of Arrays

Over to Processing for a practical example
---

### The Collection API

All explained in the [Javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Collection.html)

----

#### Types of Collection

- **[List](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html)** - an ordered sequence of elements
- **[Set](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Set.html)** - a _unique_ group of elements
- **[Queue](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Queue.html)** - similar to a list but holds elements waiting for processing

----

### Maps

- Maps aren't exactly _collections_ but they're often thought of together
- A Map _maps_ **keys** to **values**
